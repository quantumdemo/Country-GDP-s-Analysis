**Overview**

The Country's GDP Comparison Dashboard is a visual analytics tool designed to display and compare the GDP of various countries over selected years. It allows users to easily view and analyze GDP trends, facilitating insights into economic growth and comparison among countries. This project is built using Excel and provides a clear graphical representation and summary of GDP data in trillions of USD.

**Features**

Yearly GDP Comparison: Compare GDP values across selected countries for each year.

Interactive Year Filter: Users can filter the data by year using the "Years" slicer to display GDP data for a particular year.

Graphical Representation: The dashboard includes a line chart that plots GDP values in trillions of USD, making it easy to observe trends and differences.

Summary Table: Displays the sum of GDP values for each country for the selected year.

**Dashboard Components**

Line Chart: Shows the GDP in trillions of USD for each selected country. It visualizes trends and allows for easy comparison.

Summary Table: Lists GDP values for each country in trillions of USD, as well as the total GDP for all displayed countries.

Year Filter (Slicer): An interactive filter that allows users to select a year (from 2016 to 2023) to view data specific to that year.

**Countries Included**

The dashboard includes data for the following countries:

1. Australia
2. Canada
3. China
4. India
5. Russia
6. USA
   
**Usage**

Open the Dashboard: Open the Excel file to access the dashboard.
Select a Year: Use the slicer on the right-hand side to select a specific year. The chart and table will automatically update to display GDP data for the chosen year.

Analyze Data: View the line chart for trends and check the table for precise GDP figures.

**Project Structure**

Excel Workbook: Contains the dashboard, data, and interactive filters.

Line Chart: A graphical representation of GDP for each country.

Summary Table: Lists GDP by country and total GDP for the selected year.

Year Slicer: Allows for year-based filtering.

**Data Source**

The GDP data used in this dashboard is hypothetical and meant for demonstration purposes. In real-world applications, data can be sourced from reliable sources like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund (IMF).

**Future Enhancements**

Real-Time Data Updates: Integrate with external data sources to automatically update GDP data.
Additional Metrics: Include other economic indicators like GDP growth rate, inflation, or per capita GDP for a more comprehensive analysis.
More Countries: Expand the list of countries for broader global coverage.
